# Decentralized Galactic Resource Exchange (DGRE)

## Overview
The Decentralized Galactic Resource Exchange (DGRE) is a blockchain-based platform facilitating interstellar trade and resource management across multiple star systems. The platform enables secure, efficient exchange of resources between different planetary civilizations while managing complex logistics and value calculations.

## Core Components

### Resource Registration Contract
Maintains a comprehensive database of available resources across participating planets.

Key features:
- Resource classification system
- Quantity tracking
- Quality verification
- Rarity indexing
- Planetary origin verification
- Sustainability monitoring
- Hazard classification

### Interstellar Trading Contract
Manages the exchange of resources between star systems.

Key features:
- Smart contract trading
- Multi-party transactions
- Escrow services
- Dispute resolution
- Trade verification
- Contract enforcement
- Cross-species agreements

### Value Equivalence Contract
Determines fair exchange rates for diverse resources across different civilizations.

Key features:
- Universal value calculation
- Cultural value adjustment
- Rarity scaling
- Transport cost integration
- Time-value compensation
- Risk assessment
- Market dynamics tracking

### Transport Coordination Contract
Orchestrates the complex logistics of interstellar resource movement.

Key features:
- Route optimization
- Fleet management
- Temporal coordination
- Resource tracking
- Environmental controls
- Safety protocols
- Delivery verification

## Technical Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
- Quantum communication arrays
- Interstellar tracking beacons
- Resource scanning systems

- Environmental control units

### Software Requirements
- Universal translator interface
- Quantum blockchain client
- Route calculation engine
- Value computation system
- Risk assessment tools

## Usage

### Resource Registration
```solidity
function registerResource(
    bytes32 planetId,
    ResourceDetails memory details,
    uint256 quantity,
    bytes32 verificationProof
) external returns (bytes32 resourceId)
```

### Trade Initiation
```solidity
function initiateTrade(
    bytes32 resourceOffered,
    bytes32 resourceRequested,
    uint256 quantity,
    bytes32 transportDetails
) external returns (bytes32 tradeId)
```

### Value Calculation
```solidity
function calculateEquivalence(
    bytes32 resourceA,
    bytes32 resourceB,
    uint256 quantity,
    bytes32 contextData
) external returns (uint256 exchangeRate)
```

## Safety Protocols

### Resource Safety
- Hazardous material containment
- Biological contamination prevention
- Radioactive material handling
- Chemical reaction prevention
